premier_team_list
=================

A utility for converting Pokemon Showdown teamlists into the standard TPCi Team List document.  Finally, no more 
chickenscratch handwriting!

Upon navigating to http://tapin42.github.io/premier_team_list, simply paste your team from the Pokemon Showdown 
Teambuilder (or similarly-formatted list) and hit "OK".  The other two buttons do exactly what they claim: "Print" will
print the currently-displayed list, and "Clear" will clear all inputs.

WARNING: No validation is performed on any of the inputs!  Garbage in, garbage out.  It's your responsibility to 
double-check the output and confirm that it matches the team you're playing with!
